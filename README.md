## Overview

I created a tetris clone with the standard tetrominoe blocks and a level and scoring system. The game is coded in c++ and uses the RayLib library for graphics. 

Feel free to modify tetris settings in "tetris-constants.h" (e.g. fall down speed, scoring system, etc.). You can also add new block shapes in "blocks.h", and they will automatically be rendered into the game.

## Setup

MacOs:
```
brew install raylib
```

Linux:
```
sudo apt install libraylib-dev
```

## Running Tetris

In the home directory:

```
make run
```
